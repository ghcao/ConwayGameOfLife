# ConwayGameOfLife

  Conway's Game Of Life using implementation of Table
  
  Coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  
  - This is a cell animation game where each cell is the state of being alive or dead. 
  
# How To Play

  To start with the game, an user can select several cells at once. 
  Then, he or she can either click "Start" to automate the game or "Step" to generate every generation one step at a time.
    
    If a cell is alive or dead depends on these few rules:
    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. 
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. 
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. 
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
